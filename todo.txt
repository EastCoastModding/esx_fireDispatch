- FIND A WAY TO REMOVE VALUE FROM TABLE // scriptData.fires
- Automaticaly gt the script to handle fires (eg. Whn a car blows up, the script needs to find it, add it to the variables and handle it like a spawned fire)

- Fire spreading
- Attach the fire to the vehicle  <= Kinda done (overided by "bug")
- Add a choice in vehicles to spawn / pick random vehicle from list
- Do not spawn fires while it rains.... caus it's stupid looking...
- Add custom alarm sound

DONE:
- Fix PlaySoundFromCoords
- Added Rythm to the alarm
- Removable fires
- All client synced for firespawning and removing
- Added particles to make the fires look better
- When entity "fire" is removed, attached fire particle is destroyed
