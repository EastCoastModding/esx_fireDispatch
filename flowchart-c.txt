fireHornLocation (locations of firestations, where will the alarm be played?) - X(int) Y(int) Z(int) NAME(string)

fireSpawnLocation (locations of fires, where will the first flame spawn?) - X(int) Y(int) Z(int) NAME(string) FIRETYPE(int) ISITFUELFIRE?(bool)

------------------------------ Dispatch ------------------------------
------------------------------          ------------------------------

Registers the command
    Shows a notification (debug)
    Assigns Variables
        locates player
        introduces the variable "nearestStation"
    
    For as many entities there are in fireHornLocations do:
        Finds distance between currentChecked station and player
        introduces "nearestStationDiff"

        if "nearestStationDiff" has not been set yet:
            set "nearestStation" as current station
            updates "nearestStationDiff"
        if "nearestStationDiff" is already set:
            set "nearestStationDiff" as distance to player and nearest station so far
        end

        if currentChecked station is closer or equal to the player and nearest before then
            assign new nearest station
            debug stuff
        end
    end

    playing the alarm:
        a bunch of for loops creating a pattern

Registers the command
    Sends the data over to the server which will send it back to every client to process on their own

Recives back the sync (runs on all clients)
    Finds a random number between 1 and the number of entities in the array "fireSpawnLocation"

    Used for calls wich a vehicle:
        Does stuff to spawn car

    A bunch of stuff to avoid crashing

    Still figuring out what that does

    If the type of fire is "1"
        Spawns car
        Starts fire under the engine (that's why fire is slightly away from car coords)
    If the type of fire is anything else
        Starts fire on location

        Gets a random number
        Half the times:
            Spawns awsome looking particles1 (not acctual fire but still deals damage?)
        other half:
            Spawns awsome looking particles2 (not acctual fire but still deals damage?)

    End
End
